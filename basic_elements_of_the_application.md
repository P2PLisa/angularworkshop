# Basic Elements of The Application

As far as AngularJS goes, it is a front-end, or UI framework for Javascript.  Basically this means that while it makes your webapp look fantastic, you will need some sort of backend to actually be able to deploy the app.  For this tutorial, we will be using Node.js.  

*Disclaimer:  This tutorial will not go over Node.js, since it is only being used for deployment purposes and nothing else.  Everything important is on the front-end.*

Okay now to make our webapp actually appear, we need our index.html file.  At the very top of it, you'll see 
```<!-- index.html -->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>```
